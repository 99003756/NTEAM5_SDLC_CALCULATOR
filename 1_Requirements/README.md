 ## Introduction 
   
   It is a basic calculator that will allow users to perform operations in mathematics( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc). However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 operator2 number3" (i.e 2+4*10). The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
